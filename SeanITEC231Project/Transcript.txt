One of the core principles behind the design of the internet was that users from everywhere
00:08
should get the same experience.
00:11
Censored Planet is the first global internet censorship observatory that collects data
00:18
continuously from more than 170 countries without end user’s participation.
00:41
The reason why I am interested to monitor and bring transparency and accountability
00:45
to this phenomenon is that I strongly believe that it takes away opportunity and it degrades
00:51
human dignity for many who experience it.
00:54
The technology behind internet censorship is becoming cheaper and cheaper, so it is
00:59
very affordable for governments, states, you name it, to just buy this and deploy it.
01:06
There are 3 common ways that the governments block content:
01:12
One is by blocking the IP address. There is also DNS poisoning where the DNS query is going
01:21
to be poisoned or redirected to where the content is not there. And the third kind is
01:26
application layer blocking or keyword blocking where the censor monitors the traffic and
01:32
notices there is sensitive keyword that is being communicated. As a result of that it’s
01:38
blocked or actually it shows the user a block page where it says this content is not legal.
01:44
So Censored Planet captures all of these 3 kinds of monitoring techniques

I grew up with the internet being censored either by university, by government, or more
02:31
importantly by servers who provide the information. More and more I realized that internet censorship
02:38
should be put into global perspective. It’s not just Iran, just China. Trying to have
02:44
control on what people or citizens of one country can see is a mission of all the governments.
02:50
It’s just what they care about and what they might want to block. What I think is
02:56
important is having a transparency on the process. Who is deciding to block what and
03:01
do we have trust in those people for the decisions they’re making.
